GeoSolve — Full Project Description (for AI or Developers)

GeoSolve is an advanced, AI-powered Math & Geometry Web Application developed by CALCORE.
The goal is to create a smooth, modern, fast web app that can:
solve math problems, explain steps, analyze images, perform OCR, visualize geometry, and provide AI tutoring.

🎯 Main Objectives

GeoSolve should function as:

1. Math Problem Solver

Accepts math queries like:

solve 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0

integrate x^2 sin(x)

differentiate tan(x)

Supports algebra, calculus, trigonometry, matrices, and statistics.

Generates step-by-step explanations using:

Local symbolic logic (SymPy-based)

Optional Gemini API for more advanced breakdowns

2. Geometry Visualizer

Accepts commands like:

triangle 3 4 5

circle 7

Automatically draws shapes

Computes area, perimeter, angles, and properties

Uses plotted graphs (PNG/base64 from backend)

3. Multimodal Input System

GeoSolve must support:

a) Image OCR

User uploads an image of a handwritten or printed math problem

AI extracts text using:

EasyOCR (preferred for handwriting)

Tesseract fallback

b) Sketch Input

User draws on canvas (React canvas API)

Canvas image sent to backend OCR → converted to equations

c) PDF Extraction

Upload PDF → extract text using pdfplumber

4. AI Tutoring Features

Conversational explanations

“Explain steps” for equations & integrals

Generate practice problems & quizzes

Supports difficulty levels:

High School

Standard

College

5. Gemini API Integration

Takes user query + detected math problem

Produces:

Step-by-step explanations

Alternative solving methods

Concept breakdowns
